         Older platforms don't have Theme.Holo.DialogWhenLarge; we will define
         our own wrapper theme that uses it only when running on the appropriate
         platform version.  On older platforms, we always use the generic
         fullscreen theme, because they don't support some feature that help
         in correctly laying out an activity as a dialog.
